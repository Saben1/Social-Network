## Social Network API

The Social Network API is a Node.js app that demonstrates an alternative way to manage a site's backend without using MySQL. It utilizes MongoDB with Mongoose and Express to handle database functions. The API allows users to seed the database with Users, create Thoughts associated with those Users, let Users post Reactions to a Thought, and add each other as Friends. Additionally, it supports updating Users and Thoughts.
